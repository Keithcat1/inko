# Detection of Inko keywords using perfect hashing.
#
# The code in this module was originally generated using gperf using the
# following command:
#
#     gperf -m100 keywords.txt
#
# Here `keywords.txt` contains a sorted list of all the keywords of Inko. The
# generated C code was then ported to Inko by hand.
#
# Since this code is based on generated code, changing it may produce
# unexpected results. For example, the various lookup tables in this module
# should not have their order changed.

# The associated values for the first and second bytes in a keyword.
