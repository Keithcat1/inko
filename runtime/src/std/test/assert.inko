#! Assertions for writing unit tests.
#!
#! Assertions can be used to define requirements that must be met for a unit
#! test to pass. For example, the `equal` method can be used to assert that two
#! values must be equal to each other.
#!
#! Assertions will throw in the event of a failure, requiring the use of the
#! `try` keyword. The use of `try!` is discouraged as it will result in the
#! entire test suite terminating in the event of an assertion failing.
