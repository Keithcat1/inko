# The base type for methods, closures, and lambdas.
#
# All methods, closures and lambdas are an instance of the `Block` type. Since
# blocks can have different arguments, return types, throw types, etc, the
# `Block` type itself only defines a few basic methods. For example, creating
# loops is done using the `std::loop` module, instead of by sending a message to
# a closure.
