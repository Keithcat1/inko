Inko is a programming language for building concurrent software with confidence,
and has been under development since 2015.

The Inko manual contains information about how to get started with Inko, a
reference for existing users, details about the standard library and compiler,
how to contribute to Inko's development, and more.

The manual assumes you have prior experience working with programming languages,
and that you are familiar with terminal emulators.

You can contribute to the manual by submitting changes or bug reports to the
[Inko repository](https://github.com/inko-lang/inko).

## Structure

The manual is divided into the following sections:

- **Setting up**: how to set up your development environment for Inko
- **Getting started**: everything you need to know to get started with Inko
- **Guides**: how to perform specific tasks such as writing unit tests or
  generating documentation
- **References**: reference material, such as an overview of the syntax, how to
  structure projects, or how to contribute to Inko's development
- **Design**: details on various design and implementation decisions, the goals
  of the project, and more

If you're new to Inko, start by working your way through the "Setting up" and
"Getting started" sections.
