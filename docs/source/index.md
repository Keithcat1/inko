# Introduction

!!! note
    We are still working on porting content from our old manual into this new
    one. Until this work is complete, some documentation may be missing.

Welcome to the Inko manual. The manual contains a wide range of topics, such as
guides for beginners, the internals of the virtual machine, how to contribute to
Inko, and more. The manual assumes you have prior experience working with
programming languages, and that you are familiar with terminal emulators.

If you are new to Inko, start by reading through the chapters in the "Getting
started" section.

You can contribute to the manual by submitting a merge request to the [Inko
repository](https://gitlab.com/inko-lang/inko). If you find any problems, such
as typos or broken links, please submit a bug to the [issue
tracker](https://gitlab.com/inko-lang/inko/-/issues).
