Now that you have a better understanding what Inko is all about, you should take
a look at more advanced material.

The "Guides" section contains various practical guides, such as
[how to write unit tests](../guides/tests) or [how to cross compile your
code](../guides/cross-compilation).

The "References" section contains detailed references of Inko, such as its
[syntax](../references/syntax) or [how to structure a
project](../references/structure).
